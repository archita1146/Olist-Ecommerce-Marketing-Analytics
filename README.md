# Olist-Ecommerce-Marketing-Analytics
The objective of this project is to propose an analytical view of olist e-commerce in Brazil. For this we will first go through an exploratory data analysis using graphical tools to create self explanatory plots for better understanding what is behind braziian online purchasing. After that we will use RFM MOdelling and K means for Customer Segmentations to increase retention rate and segment them into homogeneous groups, understand the traits/behaviour of each group, and engage them with relevant targeted campaigns.
